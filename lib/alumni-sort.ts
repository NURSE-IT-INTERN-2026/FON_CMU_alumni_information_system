 * Client-side sorting for the merged all-alumni table.
 *
 * The all-alumni manage table merges CMU Registrar rows with local DB rows
 * (see the `manageQuery` in `app/(admin)/management/all-alumni/page.tsx`).
 * The CMU proxy (`/api/cmu-alumni`) can only sort by CMU fields
 * (name/surname/level/major/year) — local-only fields like `birthDate`,
 * `prefix`, `firstName` have no CMU counterpart and silently fall back to
 * student_id, so those column headers would be cosmetic without this sort.
 *
 * This module is client-safe (no Prisma / Node imports) so it can be imported
 * from the client page component and unit-tested directly.
